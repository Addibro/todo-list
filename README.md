# todo-list
This is a simple todo-list in Javascript.

To use, follow these steps:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Make sure you have mongodb installed, otherwise run `brew install mongodb`
    1. Create a "db" dir `mkdir -p /data/db
    2. Make sure that the /data/db has permission: `sudo chown -R 'id -un' /data/db`
3. Start the mondo server: `mongod`
4. Run app with `npm start`

Should be good to go!
